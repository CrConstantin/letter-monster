<h2>- What is Letter Monster?</h2>
- Letter Monster is a text rendering engine. It renders letters in a very similar way to a game engine that renders pixels.<br />
- It can transform images into ASCII Text, mono-color or multi-color Excel tables, mono-color or multi-color HTML tables.<br />
- It can create text shapes and text interfaces.<br />
- It can generate mono-color or multi-color ASCII animations. Animations are programable and can interact with the user. They can be used for ASCII movies, web design, or games. They can be embeded into websites, or can become standalone applications.<br />
- There are two distinct versions of Letter Monster : colored and non-colored. In colored version, each letter has a color, in non-colored version, only plain letters are used to describe shapes.<br />
- Letter Monster Backpack can edit large TXT files : rotate, mirror, align, crop, resize, or border.<br />
- Letter Monster is 100% free. No hidden costs. You can use it anywhere, anyhow, anytime. Letter Monster will always be free, for home or commercial users.<br />
<br />

<h2>- Concept</h2>
<h5>- Letter Monster has personality.</h5>
He hates bitmap images like BMP, JPG and PNG and enjoys devouring them. Show him one : he'll consume it imediately and spawn a tiny LMGL (Letter Monster Graphical Letters) file. This little file has the potential to become a great ASCII image in TXT, Excel or HTML format, or a complex ASCII animation.<br />
LMGL file format can store any number of ASCII text, using separate layers. Layers can be visible, transparent or invisible, so the underneath layers are seen more or less.<br />
LMGL file format can store ASCII animations. Animations can be created automatically, by morphing one layer into another, by making one or more layers become transparent or change their position, or created manually, by specifying each frame, like in a normal animation. Combinations of manual and automatic animations are allowed too.<br />
LMGL file format can store any number of events.<br />

<h5>- Letter Monster is proud.</h5>
Don't even try to compare Letter Monster with an ordinary ASCII art generator. He'll get very pissed.
ASCII generators simply transform images into TXT or colored HTML. Letter Monster does this too, giving you A LOT of options, but to him, that's just piece of cake.<br />

<h5>- Letter Monster is always hungry.</h5>
He never gets tired of consuming his favorite food : tasty rasterrr imageees... Yumm yumm.<br />

<h5>- Letter Monster wears a Backpack.</h5>
Inside his Backpack, there are a lot of tools for manipulating text.<br />
